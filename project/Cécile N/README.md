# Hands dirty - a beginner walkthrough of the course concepts with implementation

## Short description of the project

In this showcase project my goal is to apply the whole course from concepts through preparing the data and up to evaluating model performance.
I want to focus this project on knowledge and show how this whole process can be implemented with a dataset. My purpose is really to explain clearly each concept and associate the implementation.
As I dont have a lot of time - I'm a working mom ;) - I will focus on a supervised two-class classification using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. If I still have time I will do the same with a supervised regression problem.

## Team

**Slack name :** Cécile N. => I'm alone on this one

## Who this project is for ?

This project is aimed to help beginners like me to have in one project the synthetic visualization of the concepts, the process and an implementation of this.

## Used technologies

❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️ TODO
/!\ Brouillon 
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3)
- GitHub Desktop
- Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)
- Python

## First implementation - Titanic
### Data used

The data I use for this first implementation are the [data on the Titanic from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

### Steps

- [Analyse the type of problem you are facing](https://github.com/NAVERGONI/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/blob/master/project/C%C3%A9cile%20N/AnalyzeTheProblem.ipynb)

- [Explore and prepare your data](https://github.com/NAVERGONI/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/blob/master/project/C%C3%A9cile%20N/ExploreAndPrepareYourData.ipynb)

- Train your model

- Evaluate your model
