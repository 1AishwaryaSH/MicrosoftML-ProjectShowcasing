# Hands dirty - a beginner walkthrough of the course concepts with implementation

## short description of the project

In this showcase project my goal is to apply the whole course from concepts through preparing the data and up to evaluating model performance.
I want to focus this project on knowledge and show how this whole process can be implemented with a dataset. My purpose is really to explain clearly each concept and associate the implementation.
As I dont have a lot of time - I'm a working mom ;) - I will focus on a supervised two class classification using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. If I still have time I will do the same with a supervised regression problem.
