    "- Supervised learning : learns from data that contains both the inputs **AND** expected outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning : learns from data that contains only inputs and finds hidden structures in data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning : learns how an agent should take actions in an environment to maximize a reward function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Titanic dataset *we know if a person survived or not* => **we have the inputs** (age, sex, ...) **AND** the **expected outputs** (survival = 0 or 1).\n",
