PROJECT NAME:
Classify The right Customer

PROJECT DONE BY:
Sayed Ahmed

ABOUT:
In this project I have worked with a particular dataset. The problem is to detect discrete values or classes or a potential customer. I have used different classification algorithms to solve the problem. The code for each algorithm is added to this repository. I have compared the results of multiple classifiers and opted the best ones for this problem. 

USED LIBRARIES AND IMPLEMENTED KNOWLEDGE:
The code has been trained using python and the knowledge gained from course is implemented here.
1.	Pandas
2.	Matplotlib
3.	Sickit learn
implemented Knowledge from course work
1.	Scaling data
2.	Reducing overfitting, underfitting
3.	Data preprocessing
4.	Ensemble Algorithm
5.	Model Evaluation, Confusion Matrixes 
6.	Plotting predicted result
7.	Dimensionality reduction
