# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship Project Showcasing Challenge

A platform to keep and showcase all the open sources projects that are implemented from individual or study groups of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship from Udacity.

# Guidelines:

Please structure your submission using the following steps:
- Create a directory with your **slack username** in the [project](https://github.com/mhmohona/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/tree/master/project) folder.
- Structure your code into one or more Python modules in that directory.
  - Code should be well-documented. Each function should include a docstring.
- Include a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a run of your code showing printed output, a graph, etc.
  - Code cells in the notebook should only call functions defined in your modules. Please do not include any actual code logic in the notebook itself.
  - The notebooks should be well-documented. Ideally, each code cell should be preceded by a Markdown cell describing why you have included the code cell. It can also include comments on the output generated, eg. describing features of a graph. These text cells should be more high-level than actual code comments, describing the narrative or thought process behind your steps.
