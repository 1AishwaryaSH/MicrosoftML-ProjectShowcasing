# Microsoft ML-Scholarship-Project-Showcasing-Challenge
A repository to keep all open sources projects that created by individuals or study groups of Microsoft ML Scholarship

# Guidelines:
Please structure your submission using the following steps:
- Create a directory with your **slack username** in the project folder
- Structure your code into one or more Python modules in that directory
  - Code should be well-documented. Each function should include a docstring.
- Include a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a run of your code showing printed output, a graph, etc.
  - Code cells in the notebook should only call functions defined in your modules. Please do not include any actual code logic in the notebook itself.
  - The notebooks should be well-documented. Ideally, each code cell should be preceded by a Markdown cell describing why you have included the code cell. It can also include comments on the output generated, eg. describing features of a graph. These text cells should be more high-level than actual code comments, describing the narrative or thought process behind your steps.
